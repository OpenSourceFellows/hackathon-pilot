# ProgramEquity Hackathon 
Our goal is to build out a platform, called Amplify, that will help digitally transform advocacy led by marginalized communities on Turtle Island. ProgramEquity Hacks has gathered the specifications for the Amplify platform from over 40+ advocacy groups which participants will be evolving via implementation and design ideation.

Collaborate on familiar workflows you would at work but at a hackathon that brings the world together - ProgramEquity Hackathons are driven and designed through community dialogue through skillbased volunteer workflows. 9 hours. 40 advocacy groups and Indigenous led land trusts. Unified climate action.

## Story
Indigenous people protect over 80% of the world's diversity, this hackathon is an opening conversation for us to start understanding our relationship with our earth and the very ground we stand on today as sentient. Our connection with our Earth is fostered through climated action and we're dedicating the day to evolving the Amplify platform to accomodate more than 40+ advocacy groups based in sustainability.

Land acknowledgement is an important first step, the journey is to remember that sustainability happens when we transform the dynamic of land belonging to us to how we can belong to the land we occupy. 

_In the 7th generation prophecy of Turtle island (now known as the United States), we will be given a choice. By the light of the Seventh Fire come the Ogichidaag', those who would use their power and strength with wisdom and gentleness to bring harmony and balance. They will soar with wabishkie ginu', the White Eagle, bringing the wisdom of Spirit with the first light of day. They will learn of their power and strength like the gidzhii makwa' the Great Bear who holds ice and snow in the North so the Earth would not be covered with water. And they will open their mind and heart like makinaak' the turtle who offered his back upon which to build a new earth._

ProgramEquity Hacks brings the community informed design to an open source workflow. When designing for marginalized communities, we found that past attempts at civic engagement were found to have created insignificant changed in the communities they sought to solve for. The MIT study astutley observed that tech solutions must engage with the ecosystem before designing for solutions. Goals between CivTech, understanding of bureaucratic processes and leading by the impacted group leads to results that fall short of the vision is often due a lack of communication. [MIT GOVLAB](https://mitgovlab.org/news/is-civic-tech-fulfilling-its-promise/) found “government bureaucratic norms are understudied”.
   
### Community Informed Design Explained 
As a result, this open source initiative addresses solutions as ecosystems ranging from the constituent, Advocacy experts, DevSecOps architects, and OSS maintainership lens. 
   - Our **first layer** of defining the problem looks at the pain points of users (these workshops will be provided throughout the day)
     - User advocacy research via [MERL ](https://merltech.org/)
     - Data protection and compliance through [PII](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/devops/data-privacy-and-protection/introduction-to-devops-security-privacy-and-compliance/)
     - Person informed design via [TrueNorth](https://www.truenorthedi.com/how-we-work.html)
   - Our **second layer** focuses on implementation and orchestrates things via a [DevSecOps workflow](https://github.com/learn/devops)
   - Our **third layer** focuses on the sustainability and security of the project on open source through an [MVG framework ](https://github.blog/2021-07-22-minimum-viable-governance-lightweight-community-structure-foss-projects/)
