### ProgramEquity Hackathon
Indigenous people protect over 80% of the world's diversity, this hackathon is an opening conversation for us to start understanding our relationship with our earth and the very ground we stand on today as sentient.

Our goal is to digitally transform advocacy led by marginalized communities on Turtle Island. ProgramEquity Hacks is designed to [add what the goal of the hackathon is here]

# What will you do at the hackathon

The goal of the hackthon is to build out a platform, called Amplify, that will help digitally transform advocacy led by marginalized communities on Turtle Island. There are two challenge areas:
- Ideation (add info her)
- Implementation (work on Issues, add link here)

## Story

Land acknowledgement is an important first step, the journey is to remember that sustainability happens when we transform the dynamic of land belonging to us to how we can belong to the land we occupy. 

_In the 7th generation prophecy of Turtle island (now known as the United States), we will be given a choice. By the light of the Seventh Fire come the Ogichidaag', those who would use their power and strength with wisdom and gentleness to bring harmony and balance. They will soar with wabishkie ginu', the White Eagle, bringing the wisdom of Spirit with the first light of day. They will learn of their power and strength like the gidzhii makwa' the Great Bear who holds ice and snow in the North so the Earth would not be covered with water. And they will open their mind and heart like makinaak' the turtle who offered his back upon which to build a new earth._

### Program Highlights 
Participants will spend the day across multiple workshops led by DEI firms and land trusts as we put on the lend of a community informed design framework. Full agenda attached iin team set up.

ProgramEquity Hacks brings the community informed design to an open source workflow. When designing for marginalized communities, we found that past attempts at civic engagement were found to have created insignificant changed in the communities they sought to solve for. The MIT study astutley observed that tech solutions must engage with the ecosystem before designing for solutions. Goals between CivTech, understanding of bureaucratic processes and leading by the impacted group leads to results that fall short of the vision is often due a lack of communication. [MIT GOVLAB](https://mitgovlab.org/news/is-civic-tech-fulfilling-its-promise/) found ‚Äúgovernment bureaucratic norms are understudied‚Äù.
   
### Community Informed Design Explained 
As a result, this open source initiative addresses solutions from the constituent, implementation, and OSS maintainership lens. We'll dive deeper in yoour enablement packets, here are some frameworks to familiarize yourself if you'd like a head start. 
   - Our **first layer** of defining the problem looks at the pain points of users (these workshops will be provided throughout the day)
     - User advocacy research via [MERL ](https://merltech.org/)
     - Data protection and compliance through [PII](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/devops/data-privacy-and-protection/introduction-to-devops-security-privacy-and-compliance/)
     - Person informed design via [TrueNorth](https://www.truenorthedi.com/how-we-work.html)
   - Our **second layer** focuses on implementation and orchestrates things via a [DevSecOps workflow](https://github.com/learn/devops)
   - Our **third layer** focuses on the sustainability and security of the project on open source through an [MVG framework ](https://github.blog/2021-07-22-minimum-viable-governance-lightweight-community-structure-foss-projects/)

### How we work together 
Coordinators willl be there to support in 4 hour shifts. Participants will be participating from 8 am to 4 pm pt. ![my-visual_57379715](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42981589/149043578-bda47fa0-b9a3-4c75-84c8-3b0c539b7dd1.png)

 <img width="1114" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-11 at 12 23 45 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9143339/149015895-011540da-9f9b-4ad7-8068-cdd1d2c8ad36.png">

**Choose a Track with your team**

During the hackathon, after pod team set up - you can collectively decide which track you would like to participate within the hackathon: implementation or improvement 

_Implementation_: 
There will be issues and tasks that are written out and scoped starting from 'good first issue' to intermediate across the different skillsets 

_Improvement_: 
Use your critical thinking and design skills to suggest code changes, buildsafes, and even architectural design
