# ProgramEquity Hacks <a name = "story"></a>
ProgramEquity Hacks are driven and designed through community dialogue through skillbased volunteer workflows. 5 hours, 40 advocacy groups and Indigenous led land trusts, unified climate action. 

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9143339/149373941-0cb553e6-c6d8-4905-8436-35506d448aec.mp4


[Indigenous people protect over 80% of the world's diversity](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/can-indigenous-land-stewardship-protect-biodiversity-), this hackathon is an opening conversation for us to start understanding our relationship with our earth and the very ground we stand on today as sentient. 

Our connection with our Earth is fostered through climated action and we're dedicating the day to evolving the [Amplify platform](https://github.com/ProgramEquity/hackathon-landing/blob/main/AmplifyApp.md) to accomodate more than 40+ advocacy groups based in sustainability.

Sustainability happens when we transform the dynamic of land belonging to us to how we can belong to the land we occupy. This work is often led by advocacy groups who just like open source - rely on volunteer contributors. 
 


## Challenge: <a name = "challenge"></a>
Take the [Amplify app](https://github.com/ProgramEquity/hackathon-landing/blob/main/AmplifyApp.md) to the next level so its robust enough to go from supporting **~40 advocacy groups to hundreds** across civic rights and sustanability.
